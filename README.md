# gpu-ninja
A set of exercises designed to teach Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) working and architecture and demonstrate best practices from a performance critical point of view.

# Existing trainging material online
I tried nvidia courses material (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-education) but it is all either paid or to high level.
